# 1. Game Overview
Alternate Earth is a medieval-themed MMO RPG that blends real-world geospatial data with immersive fantasy gameplay. The game uses the actual Earth map as its base layer, allowing players to begin their journey from their real-life location. Central to the game is a unique flag system that governs territory control, fast-travel mechanics, and spatial exploration. This system not only defines movement but also anchors most game entities—such as dungeons, marketplaces, and player houses—to specific geographic locations.

## 2. Geospatial Integration and World Layout

### 2.1. Real-World Map Integration

Starting Point: Players enter the game at their real-life geographic location.
Dynamic World: The game world is structured over the Earth map, where each player’s environment reflects a portion of the real world, enriching the immersive experience.

### 2.2. Movement Boundaries

Local Movement: Players are initially confined to a 600-meter radius around their current flag or starting point.
Exploration Mechanism: To explore beyond the immediate area, players must establish new flags, effectively “jumping” their active area of influence across the map.

## 3. The Flag System

### 3.1. Core Mechanic

Flag Placement: Flags serve as markers that players can place on the map. Each flag claims a territory with a radius of approximately 500 meters.
Travel & Teleportation: Selecting a flag enables players to “jump” directly to that location, serving both as a fast-travel mechanism and a method for expanding their controlled territory.

### 3.2. Strategic Importance

Territory Control: The flag system is the backbone of territorial expansion. Players must strategically choose where to plant flags to maximize resource access, secure dungeons, or control key geographical regions.
Gameplay Impact: This mechanic creates a dynamic interplay between exploration and defense, as the placement and defense of flags can be pivotal in PvP encounters and resource management.

## 4. Location-Bounded Entities

### 4.1. Fixed World Elements

Dungeons: While the overworld is geospatial (using real-world coordinates), dungeons are designed as traditional spatial zones with defined (x, y) coordinates. Think of dungeons as “pocket” worlds separate from the Earth map.
Marketplaces & Player Houses: All key interactive locations—such as marketplaces, houses, and guild halls—are tied to fixed real-world positions. This means that other players can visit these sites, encouraging community interaction and strategic social gameplay.

### 4.2. Social Interactions and PvP/PvE

Player Houses: Because these are location-bound, they can act as hubs for social interaction and commerce. Players may also establish defenses for their properties against potential invaders.
PvP and PvE Zones: Combat zones, resource-rich areas, and contested territories will naturally emerge, governed by the presence of player-placed flags and the density of location-bound entities.

## 5. Overworld vs. Dungeon Dynamics

### 5.1. The Overworld

Geospatial Gameplay: The main game world operates on the Earth’s geography, with the flag system enabling movement and exploration.
Living World: As players build and control territories, the overworld becomes a living, evolving map with economic, social, and strategic layers.

### 5.2. Dungeons as Separate Worlds

Spatial Separation: Dungeons are not bound by the Earth map’s lat/long system but are instead designed using traditional two-dimensional coordinates.
Gameplay Purpose: These zones are designed for intensive PvE combat, resource challenges, and exploration, offering a contrasting experience to the geospatial overworld.

## 6. Resource Gathering and Economic Systems

Gathering Mechanics: Players will be able to harvest resources from the environment, which are naturally distributed based on location.
Economy: The economy will likely be decentralized, with marketplaces reflecting the real-world locations. The territorial influence provided by flags can affect resource availability and trade routes.
Interdependence: Resource scarcity or abundance in one geographic area may drive strategic flag placements, encouraging territorial disputes and collaborations.

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### 7.1. Geospatial Data Handling

Accuracy & Performance: Leveraging real-world coordinates means precise geospatial data must be efficiently managed to ensure smooth gameplay and accurate flag boundaries.
Data Synchronization: Real-time synchronization of player locations and interactions is crucial to maintain the integrity of the game world.

### 7.2. Server and Network Architecture

Scalability: The server infrastructure must support a dynamic and expansive world with potentially high numbers of concurrent players.
Spatial Partitioning: Consider using spatial partitioning algorithms to handle large data sets and quickly resolve interactions within the defined movement boundaries.

### 7.3. User Interface & Experience

Map Navigation: The UI should clearly display players’ current location, flag territories, and nearby location-bound entities.
Ease of Travel: The flag jump mechanism should be intuitive, allowing players to easily manage and navigate their territories.
