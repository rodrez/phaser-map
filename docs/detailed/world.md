# Integration of Real-World Data

## 1. Required Level of Precision

High-Precision Geospatial Data:

The game requires data accurate enough to precisely locate player starting points, flags, and other location-bound entities.

Accuracy Goal: Data should be precise to within approximately 10 meters. This level of precision ensures that:

- Flags and territories (with a 600-meter movement boundary and 500-meter flag radius) align correctly with real-world geography.
- Location-based dungeons, marketplaces, and player houses are accurately mapped.

Support for Unique Entities:

This precision is essential not only for navigation and territory control but also for positioning specialized game elements, such as monsters tied to specific geophysical features.

## 2. Location-Based Entities and Continental Monsters

Regional Monster Placement:

The game design includes continental monsters or region-specific monsters that are tied to real-world landmarks:

- Volcanic Areas:
  - Monsters like lava dragons or lava golems will be programmed to spawn in regions identified as volcanic, leveraging geospatial data to pinpoint active volcanoes or volcanic fields.
- Mountainous Regions:
  - Powerful ice monsters will inhabit the tallest mountains, utilizing altitude and terrain data to define their zones.

Utilization of Trusted Data Sources:

The geospatial data must come from reputable mapping services or satellite imagery to ensure these landmarks are accurately represented. (OpenStreetMap)

## 3. Reflecting Real-World Changes

Static Map with Periodic Updates:

The default game map will act as a snapshot of the real world, updated on a scheduled basis rather than in real-time.
Scheduled Refreshes:
Significant changes, such as new constructions or notable natural events, can be integrated into periodic updates (e.g., quarterly or annually) to balance realism with game stability.
Event-Based Dynamics:

Special Event Triggers:

- Major real-world events—such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or large-scale construction projects—may trigger temporary in-game events or modifications, creating dynamic gameplay moments.

Gameplay Consistency:

- Continuous real-time updates might disrupt gameplay, so changes will be curated to ensure that the game remains engaging while still reflecting an evolving world.

Data Update Mechanisms:

- API Integration:
  - For areas where dynamic changes are crucial, integration with real-time geospatial APIs may be considered, though these updates would be limited to maintain performance.

Fallback Strategy:

- If real-time data proves too variable, the game will rely on periodic data snapshots that are thoroughly tested and balanced against gameplay mechanics.

## 4. Technical and Gameplay Considerations

Balancing Realism and Game Experience:

The integration of precise geospatial data enhances immersion but must be balanced with performance and gameplay consistency.
Discrepancies between rapidly changing real-world data and the in-game environment are minimized through controlled updates.
Optimization and Performance:

- High-precision mapping data can be demanding. Efficient data handling and optimization strategies are necessary to ensure smooth gameplay across all devices.

Player Experience:

- While the game world is designed to mirror real-world locations, any updates reflecting construction or natural changes should be implemented in a way that does not disrupt player expectations or the overall narrative immersion.
