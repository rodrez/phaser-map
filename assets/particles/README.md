# Particle Assets

This directory should contain the following image files for particle effects:

- `particle.png`: A simple particle image used for various effects

## Image Specifications

- The particle image should be a PNG format with transparency
- Recommended size: 16x16 pixels
- Should be a simple shape like a circle, square, or star
- White or light-colored so it can be tinted in the game

## Placeholder Image

Until you create or obtain a proper particle image, you can use a simple white circle or dot.

You can create this placeholder image using any image editing software or generate it programmatically.
