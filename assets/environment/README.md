# Environment Assets

This directory should contain the following image files for the environment system:

- `tree.png`: A regular tree image
- `spruce.png`: A spruce tree image
- `healing-spruce.png`: A special spruce tree with healing properties
- `fruit.png`: Fruit that can be collected from healing spruce trees

## Image Specifications

- All images should be PNG format with transparency
- Recommended size: 64x64 pixels for trees, 32x32 pixels for fruits
- Trees should have a clear trunk and foliage area
- Healing spruce should have a slightly glowing effect to distinguish it

## Placeholder Images

Until you create or obtain proper images, you can use simple colored shapes:

1. For `tree.png`: A brown rectangle (trunk) with a green circle on top (foliage)
2. For `spruce.png`: A brown triangle with a green triangle on top
3. For `healing-spruce.png`: Same as spruce but with a light green glow
4. For `fruit.png`: A small red circle

You can create these placeholder images using any image editing software or generate them programmatically.
